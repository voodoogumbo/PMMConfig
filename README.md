# Archive Update - 2024 Dec 24
I'm going to go ahead and archive this content. Mostly because Plex Meta Manager doesn't exist anymore, and I've moved on to other interests.
If you've stayed with me this long, I hope you have a Merry Christmas. And kno that someone, somewhere, loves you very much. 

# PMMConfig
Personal config to help you get started with PMM.
I used a combination of help from the PMM Discord and some great folks' on Reddit to cobble together this config file for PMM. 
- It's not a direct  "plug and play" file as you'll need to add your unique PLEX token, and accompanying API keys.
- I try to do a little bit of everything with my posters. Show awards, ratings and even the age recommendation, so my config has a lot going on.
- I doubt my config is the most efficient. If you have ideas on how to make it more efficient, feel free to hit me up.
