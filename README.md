# PMMConfig
Personal config to help you get started with PMM.
I used a combination of help from the PMM Discord and some great folks' on Reddit to cobble together this config file for PMM. 
- It's not a direct  "plug and play" file as you'll need to add your unique PLEX token, and accompanying API keys.
- I try to do a little bit of everything with my posters. Show awards, ratings and even the age recommendation, so my config has a lot going on.
- I doubt my config is the most efficient. If you have ideas on how to make it more efficient, feel free to hit me up.
